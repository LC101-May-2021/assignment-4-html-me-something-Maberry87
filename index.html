           <h1>1. NXT Takeover: Chicago (5/20/17)</h1>

           <p>I attended this event with my younger brother Kyle. This show contained  two particular matches that I was interested in.  The first was for the NXT United Kingdom Championship.  This match involved the champion Pete Dunne defending the belt against his long-time rival and sometimes partner in the group British Strong Style, Tyler Bate. The other match that I was interested in was the main event of the evening. The match was for the NXT Tag Team Titles and involved #DIY (Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa) taking on the champions, The Authors of Pain (Akam and Rezar).  Once again it was a very action packed match with many thrilling sequences.  In the end AOP was able to overcome #DIY and retain their championships.  Fireworks ensued after the match when Ciampa turned on his partner Gargano which led to Gargano having to be taken out of the arena via ambulance. </p>
          
           <h1>2. Supercard of Honor XII (4/7/18)</h1>

            <figcaption>Cody vs Kenny Omega match graphic</figcaption>
           <p>This was probably one of my most interesting trips.  It included a long drive down to New Orleans.  When me and my friend Travis arrived at our hotel for the night we were told that it had been overbooked. This led to us having to sleep in the vehicle we had rented and led to a poor night of sleep in a Walmart parking lot during a thunderstorm.  This show was centered around the civil war taking place between members of the faction known as Bullet Club.  Cody Rhodes had recently been having issues with the leader of the BC, Kenny Omega.  Cody ended up winning the match through some shady tactics when a tag team and fellow BC members The Young Bucks delivered an accidental superkick to their close friend and member of BC sub-faction The Elite.  In my time as a fan the match was one of my favorites of all-time.  </p>
          
           <h1>3. All In (9/1/18)</h1>
           <img src = "https://www.voicesofwrestling.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/allin.jpg">
           <figcaption>All In logo</figcaption>
           <p>All In was a summit of wrestlers from some of the best companies in the world.  It was by far my favorite trip and show in all my time as a fan.  This particular show had something for everybody.  It was a love letter to the wonderful sport that is professional wrestling.  The show came to fruition when a wrestling journalist said that Cody Rhodes and the Youngbucks could not sell out a 10,000 seat arena.  Well the wrestling fandom made the journalist eat his words as tickets sold out in under an hour.  This show was definitely the beginning of a revolution and a precursor to the formation of All Elite Wrestling several years later.</p>
          
           <h1>4. G1 Supercard</h1>
           <img src = "https://d2isjg8ovcm7q0.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/supercard-rotor.jpg">
           <figcaption>G1 Supercard Logo</figcaption>
           <p>The G1 Supercard emanated from the world's most famous arena Madison Square Garden in NYC.  This show was a joint effort from New Japan Pro Wrestling and Ring of Honor.  As a fan MSG is one of the arena's you have to see a show at as a fan.  It was nice to check this arena off the list of places that are an important part of the sport of professional wrestling.  This show took place on the busiest weekend for wrestling of the year.  There were many good matches such as the main show opener pitting UK wrestler Will Ospreay against former Olympian turned professional wrestler Jeff Cobb.  In addition to this match I also saw one of my favorite wrestlers from New Japan defend the IWGP World Heavyweight Title.  Switchblade Jay White and Kazuchika Okada had a match for the ages for the IWGP Heavyweight Belt. Another match that I was excited for was the Triple Threat Ladder Match for the Ring of Honor World Title.  This match included Champion Jay Lethal and challengers Matt Taven and The Villain Marty Scurll.  This would culminate in ending the "conspiracy" that Matt Taven felt he was a part of.  On this night Taven would win his first world title in one of the most famous arena's in the world and silence the "conspiracy".</p>
           
           <h1>5. All Elite Wrestling Wednesday Night Dynamite (12/2/20)</h1>

           <p>This was my first and only trip during the pandemic.  It involved a 13 hour car ride from St. Louis to Jacksonville Florida.  It took about a day and a half to reach Jacksonville.  Once again I took this trip with my friend Travis.  This was a special night because once again I witnessed the return of one of my childhood favorites, Sting.  The show was capped off by a main event for the All Elite Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship.  The match involved the then AEW Champ Jon Moxley defending his belt against challenger Kenny Omega.  The match was back and forth but in the end Omega used underhanded tactics to end the reign of Moxley and become the new AEW World Champion.</p>
