           <p>I attended this event with my younger brother Kyle. This show contained  two particular matches that I was interested in.  The first was for the NXT United Kingdom Championship.  This match involved the champion Pete Dunne defending the belt against his long-time rival and sometimes partner in the group British Strong Style, Tyler Bate. The other match that I was interested in was the main event of the evening. The match was for the NXT Tag Team Titles and involved #DIY (Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa) taking on the champions, The Authors of Pain (Akam and Rezar).  Once again it was a very action packed match with many thrilling sequences.  In the end AOP was able to overcome #DIY and retain their championships.  Fireworks ensued after the match when Ciampa turned on his partner Gargano which led to Gargano having to be taken out of the arena via ambulance. </p>
          
           <h1>2. Supercard of Honor XII (4/7/18)</h1>

           <p>This was probably one of my most interesting trips.  It included a long drive down to New Orleans.  When me and my friend Travis arrived at our hotel for the night we were told that it had been overbooked. This led to us having to sleep in the vehicle we had rented and led to a poor night of sleep in a Walmart parking lot during a thunderstorm.  </p>
          
           <h1>3. All In (9/1/18)</h1>

           <h1>5. All Elite Wrestling Wednesday Night Dynamite (12/2/20)</h1>
           <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1f/AEW_Dynamite_logo.jpg/375px-AEW_Dynamite_logo.jpg">
           <p>This was my first and only trip during the pandemic.  It involved a 13 hour car ride from St. Louis to Jacksonville Florida.  It took about a day and a half to reach Jacksonville.  Once again I took this trip with my friend Travis.  This was a special night because once again I witnessed the return of one of my childhood favorites, Sting.  The show was capped off by a main event for the All Elite Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship.  The match involved the then AEW Champ Jon Moxley defending his belt against challenger Kenny Omega.  The match was back and forth but in the end Omega used underhanded tactics to end the reign of Moxley and become the new AEW World Champion.</p>
